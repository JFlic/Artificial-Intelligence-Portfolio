# The spelled-out intro to neural networks and backpropagation

I watch a tutorial by Andrej Karpathy who is one of the frontrunners in the field of machine learning and is currently working at OpenAI.
 
In this tutorial I worked on, I learned how neural networks work on at a basic level starting from how a single neuron works all the way to a full-fledged working model. I made my own clarifying notes along the way which can be found in the files themselves.

This tutorial was done in Google Colab in Python and used the TensorFlow library.

Here is the link to the Youtube video.
