# Tech With Tim Tutorial

This was a tutorial on machine learning that I watched on youtube in order to sharpen my skills in data science as well as Python.

I used Google colab and the TensorFlow library as well as learing the basics of how to work with tensors and the matrix transformations techniques using in most machine learning model creation processes. 

Here is the link to the tutorial
