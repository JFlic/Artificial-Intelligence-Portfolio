# Tech With Tim Tutorial

This was a tutorial on machine learning that I watched on youtube in order to sharpen my skills in data science as well as Python.

I used Google colab and the TensorFlow library
I learned the basics of how to work with tensors and the matrix transformations techniques using in most machine learning model creation processes.
